# PLAID Intake Guide

This guide contains the complete question bank for the PLAID vision intake. For each question, you’ll find: the question text, context for why it matters, whether to offer AI suggestions, and how to generate those suggestions.

## How to Use This Guide

For each AI-assisted question:

1. Ask the question (include the context sentence)
1. Generate 3 suggestions using the generation prompt provided
1. Present them as numbered options (1, 2, 3)
1. Include “Or tell me in your own words” as a final option
1. Carry the answer forward — every subsequent suggestion must account for it

**Important:** The opening question (“What do you want to build?”) may have already provided answers to some of these questions. Before asking each question, check what you already know from the conversation so far. Skip or pre-fill any question the founder has already answered. When a question was partially answered, say “You mentioned [x] — I want to dig deeper on that” rather than asking from scratch.

**Suggestion quality rules:**

- Suggestions must be substantively different from each other — not rephrased versions of the same idea
- Be specific and concrete, not generic
- Build naturally on what the founder has already shared
- Write in the founder’s voice (first person where appropriate)
- Get better over time — by question ~20, suggestions should be highly personalized

## Section 1: About You

### Q1.1: What’s your name?

- **AI suggestions:** None — direct input
- **Ask:** “First, what should I call you?”

### Q1.2: What’s your area of expertise?

- **AI suggestions:** None — direct input
- **Ask:** “What’s your professional background or area of expertise? This helps me tailor suggestions to your strengths.”

### Q1.3: Your background story

- **AI suggestions:** Yes
- **Ask:** “Give me the quick version — what’s your journey been and what led you to wanting to build something?”
- **Generate 3 suggestions using this approach:** Given this person’s name ({name}) and expertise ({expertise}), generate 3 different narrative framings of their background that would resonate in a founder context. Each should be 2–3 sentences. Make them substantively different — e.g. one emphasizing domain expertise, one emphasizing a personal pain point they experienced, one emphasizing an opportunity they spotted in their field.

-----

## Section 2: Your Purpose

### Q2.1: Who do you want to help?

- **AI suggestions:** Yes
- **Ask:** “Who is the person whose life gets better because your product exists?”

### Q2.3: What transformation do you want to see?

- **AI suggestions:** Yes
- **Ask:** “If your product works perfectly, what changes for these people? What does their life look like after?”
- **Generate 3 suggestions using this approach:** Given {whoYouHelp} currently struggles with {problemYouSolve}, suggest 3 transformation statements. Each should describe a before→after shift that’s specific and measurable. Frame as outcomes, not features.

### Q2.4: Why are you the right person to build this?

- **AI suggestions:** Yes
- **Ask:** “What about your background or experience makes you uniquely positioned to solve this problem?”
- **Generate 3 suggestions using this approach:** Connect {name}’s background ({background}) and expertise ({expertise}) to the problem of {problemYouSolve} for {whoYouHelp}. Generate 3 different “founder-market fit” narratives. Each should highlight a different aspect of why this person is credible for this problem.

### Q3.7: What’s the magic moment?

- **AI suggestions:** Yes
- **Ask:** “What’s the ‘aha’ moment? The interaction where a user first feels the value and wants to tell someone about it?”
- **Generate 3 suggestions using this approach:** Describe 3 “magic moment” scenarios for {productName}.

## Section 7: Tech Stack

This section uses a different format. Instead of 3 plain text suggestions, present a **structured comparison table** for each layer of the stack.

### Comparison table format

For each tech stack question, present options like this:

```
Here are 3 options for your [layer]:

**1. [Name] ✦ Recommended**
[One sentence: what it is]
✓ [Pro 1]  ✓ [Pro 2]
✗ [Con 1]  ✗ [Con 2]

**2. [Name]**
[One sentence: what it is]
✓ [Pro 1]  ✓ [Pro 2]
✗ [Con 1]  ✗ [Con 2]

**3. [Name]**
[One sentence: what it is]
✓ [Pro 1]  ✓ [Pro 2]
✗ [Con 1]  ✗ [Con 2]

Or tell me what you'd prefer — I can provide guidance for any tool.
```

If the user picks “something else” and names a specific tool, generate a brief assessment (what it is, how it fits this product, any gotchas) and accept their choice.

See <TECH-STACK-OPTIONS.md> for the default comparison data for common stacks. Adapt recommendations based on the specific product’s needs.

### Q7.1: App type

- **Format:** List choice
- **Ask:** “What type of app is this?”
- **Options:** Web app, Mobile app, Desktop app, Cross-platform

### Q7.2: Frontend framework

- **Format:** Comparison table
- **Ask:** “What should the frontend be built with?”
- **Recommendation logic:** For web apps → lean toward Next.js (best ecosystem, great with AI coding tools). For mobile → lean toward Expo/React Native. Adjust based on product complexity and real-time needs. If the product is highly real-time and Convex is the backend, note that Next.js + Convex has excellent integration.

### Q7.3: Backend

- **Format:** Comparison table
- **Ask:** “What about the backend?”
- **Recommendation logic:** Lean toward **Convex** for most cases. Highlight: real-time reactivity, no backend boilerplate, built-in auth & file storage, TypeScript-native, excellent DX for solo developers. Recommend Supabase if heavy relational data is central. Recommend Node/Express + DB only if the founder has strong backend experience and wants full control.

### Q7.4: Database

- **Format:** Comparison table
- **Ask:** “And the database?”
- **Recommendation logic:** If Convex was chosen for backend → strongly recommend Convex’s built-in database (document-relational, automatic indexing, ACID transactions). Otherwise match to backend choice: Postgres for Supabase, flexible for Node/Express.

### Q7.5: Auth provider

- **Format:** Comparison table
- **Ask:** “How should users sign in?”
- **Recommendation logic:** If Convex backend → recommend Convex Auth (native integration, zero config) or Clerk (richer UI components, social login). Otherwise → Clerk, Auth.js/NextAuth, or Supabase Auth depending on backend.

### Q7.6: Payments

- **Format:** Comparison table
- **Ask:** “How will you handle payments?”
- **Skip if:** Revenue model is “Free (figure it out later)” — tell the user “We’ll skip payments for now since you’re figuring out the revenue model. You can always add this later.”
- **Recommendation logic:** Lean toward **Polar** for SaaS/digital products. Highlight: built for developers, handles subscriptions and licensing, generous free tier, excellent API and webhook support. Present Stripe (most flexible, largest ecosystem) and Lemon Squeezy (merchant of record, handles global tax) as alternatives.

-----

## Section 8: Tooling

### Q8.1: Coding agent

- **Format:** List choice
- **Ask:** “Last one — what coding agent will you use to build this?”
- **Options:** Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Other
- If “Other”: ask “What’s the tool called?”
