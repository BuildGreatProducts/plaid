## Frontend Frameworks

### Web Apps

**Next.js** — React framework with server-side rendering, file-based routing, and excellent deployment options.

- ✓ Largest React ecosystem, huge community, extensive documentation
- ✓ App Router with server components for performance
- ✓ Excellent integration with Vercel, Convex, Clerk, and most services
- ✓ Best-supported by AI coding tools (most training data)
- ✗ Can be complex — many ways to do things (server vs client components)
- ✗ Opinionated about project structure
- **Best for:** Most web apps. Default recommendation unless there’s a specific reason not to.

**Remix** — Full-stack React framework focused on web standards and progressive enhancement.

- ✓ Excellent form handling and data loading patterns
- ✓ Progressive enhancement — works without JavaScript
- ✓ Simpler mental model than Next.js (loaders + actions)
- ✗ Smaller ecosystem than Next.js
- ✗ Less AI coding tool familiarity
- **Best for:** Form-heavy apps, content-heavy sites, apps that need to work without JS.

**SvelteKit** — Svelte framework with file-based routing and server-side rendering.

- ✓ Significantly less boilerplate than React
- ✓ Excellent performance — smaller bundle sizes
- ✓ Built-in state management (no Redux/Zustand needed)
- ✗ Smaller ecosystem and community than React
- ✗ Fewer component libraries available
- ✗ Less AI coding tool support
- **Best for:** Performance-critical apps, developers who prefer less boilerplate.

### Mobile Apps

**Expo / React Native** — Cross-platform mobile framework with managed workflow.

- ✓ Write once, run on iOS and Android
- ✓ Expo managed workflow eliminates native build complexity
- ✓ React knowledge transfers directly
- ✓ Over-the-air updates
- ✗ Performance can lag behind native for graphics-heavy apps
- ✗ Some native APIs require ejecting from managed workflow
- **Best for:** Most mobile apps. Default recommendation for mobile.

**Flutter** — Google's cross-platform UI toolkit using Dart.

- ✓ Excellent performance — compiles to native
- ✓ Beautiful, customizable UI components
- ✓ Single codebase for iOS, Android, web, desktop
- ✗ Dart is a separate language to learn
- ✗ Less ecosystem integration with JS/TS backends
- ✗ Less AI coding tool support than React Native
- **Best for:** Apps needing pixel-perfect custom UI or very high performance.

### Desktop Apps

**Electron** — Build cross-platform desktop apps with Chromium and Node.js. Powers VS Code, Slack, Discord, Figma, and Notion.

- ✓ Most mature desktop framework — battle-tested at massive scale
- ✓ Full web technology stack (HTML, CSS, JS/TS) — no new language to learn
- ✓ Largest ecosystem of plugins, tools, and community resources
- ✓ Excellent AI coding tool support (most training data)
- ✗ Heavy memory footprint — each app bundles its own Chromium instance
- ✗ Large bundle sizes (100MB+ minimum)
- ✗ Can feel non-native on macOS — requires extra work to match platform conventions
- **Best for:** Most desktop apps. Default recommendation for desktop. Especially strong when the team already knows web technologies.

**Tauri** — Lightweight desktop framework using the OS's native webview and a Rust backend.

- ✓ Dramatically smaller bundles than Electron (often 5-10MB vs 100MB+)
- ✓ Lower memory usage — uses the OS webview instead of bundling Chromium
- ✓ Rust backend for performance-critical operations and system access
- ✓ Strong security model — fine-grained permission system for system APIs
- ✗ Younger ecosystem — fewer community resources and plugins than Electron
- ✗ Rust knowledge needed for backend plugins and system integrations
- ✗ OS webview inconsistencies can cause cross-platform rendering differences
- **Best for:** Desktop apps where bundle size and memory matter, or when deep system integration is needed. Good for developers comfortable with Rust.

**Flutter (Desktop)** — The same Flutter framework listed under Mobile, with support for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

- ✓ Single codebase across mobile, web, and desktop — true cross-platform
- ✓ Compiles to native — good performance without a webview
- ✓ Consistent UI across all platforms
- ✗ Desktop support is less mature than mobile — some platform APIs are missing
- ✗ Dart ecosystem is smaller than JS/TS for desktop-specific needs
- ✗ Apps don't follow native platform UI conventions by default
- **Best for:** Projects that need a single codebase across mobile AND desktop. Not recommended for desktop-only apps — Electron or Tauri are better choices there.

## Backend

**Convex** — Reactive backend-as-a-service with built-in database, real-time sync, and TypeScript-native functions.

- ✓ Real-time data sync out of the box — no WebSocket setup

- ✗ Different mental model from traditional REST APIs
- **Best for:** Most products, especially real-time apps, solo developers, MVPs. Default recommendation.

**Supabase** — Open-source Firebase alternative built on PostgreSQL.

- ✓ PostgreSQL under the hood — full SQL power, relational data
- ✓ Real-time subscriptions, auth, storage, edge functions
- ✓ Open source — can self-host if needed
- ✓ Large and growing community
- ✗ More setup than Convex — manual schema migrations
- ✗ Real-time requires explicit subscription setup
- ✗ Edge functions are less integrated than Convex functions
- **Best for:** Products with complex relational data, teams that want SQL and open-source.

**Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL** — Traditional server setup with full control.

- ✓ Maximum flexibility — build exactly what you need
- ✓ Largest ecosystem of packages and middleware
- ✓ Full control over infrastructure and hosting
- ✗ Significant boilerplate — auth, validation, error handling, CORS, etc.
- ✗ You manage everything: database migrations, deployment, scaling
- ✗ Slower to iterate as a solo developer
- **Best for:** Experienced backend developers who want full control, or products with unusual requirements.

-----

## Database

**Convex Database** — Document-relational database built into the Convex platform.

- ✓ Automatic reactive queries — UI updates when data changes
- ✓ ACID transactions with optimistic concurrency
- ✓ Automatic indexing — define indexes in schema, they just work
- ✓ TypeScript schema validation built-in
- ✗ Only available with Convex backend
- ✗ Document-oriented — different from SQL thinking
- **Best for:** Any product using Convex backend. Use this — it’s part of the package.

**PostgreSQL** — The gold-standard open-source relational database.

- ✓ Rock-solid reliability and ACID compliance
- ✓ Full SQL power — complex queries, joins, aggregations
- ✓ Excellent for relational data with complex relationships
- ✓ Massive ecosystem of tools and extensions
- ✗ Requires migrations for schema changes
- ✗ No built-in real-time — need separate pub/sub
- **Best for:** Products with complex relational data. Pairs with Supabase or traditional backends.

**Supabase Database (PostgreSQL)** — Managed PostgreSQL via the Supabase platform with a dashboard, auto-generated APIs, and real-time subscriptions.

- ✓ Full PostgreSQL — complex queries, joins, extensions, relational power
- ✓ Auto-generated REST and GraphQL APIs from your schema
- ✓ Real-time subscriptions built in
- ✓ Row Level Security for fine-grained access control
- ✓ Dashboard with table editor — visual schema management
- ✗ Only makes sense with Supabase backend
- ✗ Migrations still needed for production schema changes
- **Best for:** Supabase backends — use this, it’s part of the package. Excellent for relational data.

**None (local-only / no database)** — The app stores data on-device only (AsyncStorage, SQLite, UserDefaults, local files).

- ✓ Zero infrastructure — no backend costs, no latency
- ✓ Works offline by default
- ✓ Simpler architecture — no sync, no API calls
- ✗ Data is lost if the user deletes the app (unless backed up)
- ✗ No cross-device sync
- ✗ No server-side logic or shared data
- **Best for:** Mobile apps that are primarily tools (calculators, trackers, utilities), offline-first apps, or MVPs that don’t need shared data. Consider adding a backend later if the product grows.

- ✓ Simpler UX — no sign-up friction, instant access
- ✓ Less infrastructure to manage
- ✓ Better for tools, utilities, and single-player experiences
- ✗ No personalization or saved preferences across devices

- **Best for:** Mobile apps that want to optimize subscription conversion through paywall experimentation. Best paired with RevenueCat for the full billing stack.

**None (no payments needed)** — The app is free with no monetization, or monetization will be added later.

- ✓ Ship faster — no payment integration complexity
- ✓ No App Store commission considerations
- ✓ Focus entirely on core product value
